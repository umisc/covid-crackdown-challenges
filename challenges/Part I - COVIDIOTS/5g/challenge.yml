    We suspect that the reason behind the multiple infections at MISC has something to do with their 5G internet. We will need to do a full trace of their internet access to confirm our suspicions.

    **Hint**: People can be so careless with what they publicise.

    **Task**: Find the WIFI password of MISC's main office

    *Disclaimer: the writers of this challenge don't actually believe 5G has anything to do with COVID-19.
