    We've snooped in on their network and captured some activity. The packet capture file is attached below.

    This whole MISC business seems like a total scam, I can't imagine anyone actually paying them money...

    **Task**: Find the amount of money MISC made in total in June

    **Submission format**: Submit the amount as an integer (e.g. `1843`)
