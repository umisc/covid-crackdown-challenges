    Yet another "Karen" has made the news, this time dubbed "Karen 2.0". She's a psychic now, but was once trained as an actor. I sure hope this "no masks" business is just an act. In 2011, she was trained at a dance academy.

    **Task**: Find the name of this dance academy and the name of her instructor while she was there

    **Submission format**: Submit the name of the dance academy and the full name (first and last name) of her instructor, all in lowercase, separated by a comma. e.g. `unversity of melbourne,duncan maskell`
