    We have had a lot of reports of scam emails related to COVID-19. The attached file contains an archive of 10000 emails. It seems that many different groups are attempting the same scam. We want to identify the most active group.

    **Task**: Find the email address that sent the most scam emails and the number of emails that they sent

    **Submission format**: Separate the email address and number of emails by a comma. e.g. `bob.smith@gmail.com,123`
