    We believe that spreading misinformation about the coronavirus is almost as bad as spreading the virus itself. Recently a few "Karens" have appeared in Melbourne, the first of whom has been dubbed "Karen from Bunnings".

    **Task**: Find the phone number of the Bunnings she visited, so we can offer our condolences to the poor staff who work there

    **Submission format**: Submit phone number in the form:

    `(XX) XXXX XXXX`
